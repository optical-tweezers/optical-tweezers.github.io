          We are a group of physicists fascinated by the interplay between physics and 
          life science. We enjoy applying our knowledge through hands-on research. 
          Our primary focus lies in experimental soft matter physics and biophysics. 
          In this field, we seek to understand the physical principles underlying 
          living systems like red blood cells.
        </p>

        <h3>What are Biophysics and Soft Matter Physics?</h3>
        <p>
          Biophysics is an interdisciplinary field that applies the principles and methods 
          of physics to study biological systems and processes. Biophysics 
          aims to understand the fundamental mechanisms of life by investigating biological 
          phenomena with a physical perspective. On the other hand, soft matter
          physics focuses on materials that exhibit unique properties due to their 
          complex structures and interactions. These materials include liquids, 
          colloids, polymers, gels, and biological tissues.
        </p>

        <h3>What We Do?</h3>
        <p>
          In order to investigate and manipulate living systems, one of the best tools 
          that can be used is the Optical Tweezer. Just as we use tweezers in the 
          macroscopic world to hold, move, and manipulate objects, in the microscopic 
          world we need a similar tool: optical tweezers. Optical tweezers use focused 
          laser beams to trap and manipulate microscopic objects, including cells and 
          biomolecules, allowing us to study their properties. For example, using this 
          method, we can investigate the mechanical properties of red blood cells. You 
          can find more about our research in the <a href="Research.html">research section</a>.<br>
          We are also preparing some experiments for the soft matter laboratory educational 
          course. This course includes experiments on the hydraulic jump, Hele-Shaw cell, 
          capillary action, viscosity, etc. You can also find more about our research on 
          these experiments in the <a href="Research.html">research section</a>.
